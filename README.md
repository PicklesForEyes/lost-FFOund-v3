Lost & FFOund (a play on the abbreviation FFO: For Fans Of) is a web app designed to help users discover new musical artists based on bands they already love, and find out if those bands are playing any shows or concerts in their area. [Daniel Blat](https://github.com/blatde91) was able to bring this idea to life with help from the coding prowess of both [Benjamin Lawson](https://github.com/picklesforeyes) and [Marina Hyers](https://github.com/marinasiena).

## How It Works

Lost & FFOund uses two API's to make the magic happen. Firstly, it uses [Last.fm's](https://www.last.fm/home) API for its its music recommendation services. Once the user inputs a musical artist, the API will return artist information and five similar artists. The other API implemented is the [Bandsintown](https://news.bandsintown.com/home) API. This API returns concert information for the searched band, along with a link to buy tickets.
